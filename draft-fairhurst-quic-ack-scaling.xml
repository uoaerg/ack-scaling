        <abstract>
            <t> On network links where the return capacity is much less than the
        forward capacity, acknowledgments of data receipt can reduce the
        efficient use of link capacity. Reducing the ratio of acknowledgements
        to data can help to improve link utilization.  This document describes
        a modification to how frequently the QUIC transport protocol <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"/> acknowledges the receipt of
        data.</t>

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
	This document proposes increasing the ratio of ACK packets to data packets from
	2:1 to 10:1 for QUIC flows once the flow has exited slow start. The increase in
	ACK ratio is proposed to not be more aggressive than the TCP Initial Window
	(IW) suggested by <xref target="RFC6928">RFC&nbsp;6928</xref>. The change in
	ACK ratio is proposed to improve return link efficiency on paths with
	asymmetric characteristics.
        </t>

        <section title="Requirements Language">
            <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Motivation">
            <t>
	When the characteristics of the forward and return paths are not symmetric, the
	transmission of ACKs can adversely impact either transport performance or the
	cost of using the network.
	</t>
            <section title="ACK ratio impact on asymmetric paths">
                <t>
		TCP Performance Implications <xref target="RFC3449"></xref>
		describes a series of problems and mitigations from using an
		asymmetric path.  Performance problems arise in several access
		networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric networks (such as
		broadband satellite access, DOCSIS cable networks, cellular
		mobile, etc), where a limited ACK rate results in constraining
		the throughput on both forward and return paths.
		</t>

		<t> Where the ACK rate is limited by the capacity of the return
		path this motivates the need to change the ACK rate (increase
		the number of segments/packets that are acknowledged by each
		ACK packet).  </t>

		<t>Capacity is not the only asymmetric path constraint.  In
		some network technologies (e.g., return link RRM allocation in
		a satellite BoD system, or an LTE scheduler in mobile) the
		sending of ACKs across a network segment can also consume
		significant transmission resource and increase the cost to the
		user/operator of the network segment. This also provides an
		incentive to reduce rate (or volume) of ACK traffic.  </t>
		
		<t> Reducing the rate of ACKs can benefit all networks
		by reducing the computational effort required to process ACKs
		and the rate of cache ejection for Generic Receiver Offload
		(GRO), both important in optimising network interfaces for high
		speed networks.</t>
            </section>

            <section title="ACK ratio modifications in other transports">
		<t> Various methods have been proposed to modify the ACK ratio
		for TCP. On satellite networks, Performance Enhancing Proxies
		(PEPs) implement functions that "Thin" TCP ACKs when they
		detect/know the upstream is filled with TCP ACK stream(s).
		There are examples of many link technologies (e.g., DOCSIS,
		LTE, Satellite) that use some form of ACK Thinning.  These
		methods only work when the ACKs can be observed by a device in
		the network and cannot work with encrypted transports such as
		QUIC.</t>

		<t> The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) <xref
		target="RFC4340"></xref> has methods to control the ACK ratio
		at the receiver. DCCP specifies a TCP-friendly congestion
		control <xref target="RFC4341"></xref>, which includes the
		ability to use signaling to allow the sender to adjust the
		receiver ACK ratio within certain parameters.  However, this
		method does not have any way to detect and account for the cost
		of ACK transmission or adapt to delays introduced by the path
		and provides only a partial mitigation to the impacts of
		asymmetric paths when sending ACKs.  </t>

		<t> ACK-CC <xref target="RFC5690"></xref> proposed a method to
		control the rate of ACKs to avoid the return path from becoming
		congested (i.e., targeting the case where the path has
		asymmetric available capacity) but this did not achieve
		wide-scale deployment.</t>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Proposed ACK ratio">
            <section title="Considerations">
		<t><xref target="RFC5681">RFC&nbsp;5681</xref> clarifies the
		ACKing frequency described in <xref
		target="RFC1122">RFC&nbsp;1122</xref> to say that TCP
		implementations should ACK every second data segment when there
		is a steady stream of data. Sending fewer than 1 ACK for each
		data segment is called using an ACK delay. ACK delays helps to
		reduce return traffic and can increase network efficiency.
		However, if a sender does not send an ACK for every second
		segment a stretch ACK violation might occur.  RFC2525 <xref
		target="RFC2525"/> describes the significance of stretch ACK
		violations: </t>

		<t>"TCP receivers exhibiting this behavior will cause TCP
		senders to generate burstier traffic, which can degrade
		performance in congested environments.  In addition, generating
		fewer ACKs increases the amount of time needed by the slow
		start algorithm to open the congestion window to an appropriate
		point, which diminishes performance in environments with large
		bandwidth-delay products.  Finally, generating fewer ACKs may
		cause needless retransmission timeouts in lossy environments,
		as it increases the possibility that an entire window of ACKs
		is lost, forcing a retransmission timeout."</t>

		<t> Any ACKing scheme that increases the ACK ratio beyond 2
		needs to compensate for these possible issues.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Selecting an ACK ratio">
		<t> We used an experimental approach to change QUIC's ACK XXX
		reference white paper XXX Policy from the default ratio of 1:2
		to 1:10.  Existing design decisions for QUIC allow an IW of 10,
		which is considered a safe number of packets to burst into a
		network in unknown conditions. An ACK ratio of 1:10 is not
		significantly different than permitting an IW of 10. Our tests
		show that this is safe to use and does not negatively impact
		congestion control, while reducing the amount of IP, UDP and
		ACK overhead by a factor of 5. Unlike TCP, QUIC sends other
		types of data frames in addition to ack frames, increasing the
		overhead on return paths. On highly asymmetrical links a ratio
		of 10 may mitigate the issue and reduce the ACK traffic enough
		to take advantage of the forward link capacity.</t>

		<t> <xref target="fig-projected"></xref> presents a table with
		asymmetry scenarios and highlights where this could be an
		issue.  The columns present the rate of ACK traffic required
		(in kbps) to fill the each of the paths.  The table shows the
		results for TCP (without a PEP), both for lossless
		communication, and the period after loss when ACKs communicate
		the loss information. It also shows the impact of using the
		proposed ACK ratio of 1:10 with QUIC. This reduces the
		utilisation of the return path.  Cases where the ACK Rate
		exceeds the return link capacity for the scenario are marked
		with a star.</t>

		<t> The presented results have been confirmed by Google, who
		use their own ACK ratio heuristics XXX needs a ref XXX.
		Although the QUIC specification recommends sending an ACK for
		every other received packet, the currently used algorithm in
		Chromium QUIC is min(max\_ack\_delay, 1/4 * min\_rtt) or 10
		packets.  Their choice of 1:10 was based also on experiments,
		and agrees with our analysis presented earlier. We understand
		that google also evaluated 1:20, but in their tested scenarios
		this did not offer an overall benefit.  </t>
