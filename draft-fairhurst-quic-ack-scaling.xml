    <keyword>ACK QUIC</keyword>

    <abstract>
        <t> On network links where the return capacity is much less than the
        forward capacity, acknowledgments of data receipt can reduce the
        efficient use of link capacity. Reducing the ratio of acknowledgements
        to data can help to improve link utilization.  This document describes
        a modification to how frequently the QUIC transport protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref> acknowledges the receipt of
        data.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">

        <t> This document proposes increasing the ratio of ACK packets to data
        packets from 2:1 to 10:1 for QUIC flows once the flow has exited slow
        start. The increase in ACK ratio is proposed to not be more aggressive
        than the TCP Initial Window (IW) suggested by RFC6928 <xref
        target="RFC6928"></xref>. The change in ACK ratio is proposed to
        improve return link efficiency on paths with highly asymmetric
        capacities.
        </t>

        <t><xref target="RFC5681">RFC&nbsp;5681</xref> clarifies the ACKing
        frequency described in <xref target="RFC1122">RFC&nbsp;1122</xref> to
        say that TCP implementations should ACK every second data segment when
        there is a steady stream of data. Sending fewer than 1 ACK for each
        data segment is called using an ACK delay. ACK delays helps to reduce
        return traffic and can increase network efficiency. However, if a
        sender does not send an ACK for every second segment a stretch ACK
        violation might occur.  RFC2525 <xref target="RFC2525"></xref>
        describes the significance of stretch ACK violations: </t>

        <t>"TCP receivers exhibiting this behavior will cause TCP senders to
        generate burstier traffic, which can degrade performance in
        congested environments.  In addition, generating fewer ACKs
        increases the amount of time needed by the slow start algorithm to
        open the congestion window to an appropriate point, which
        diminishes performance in environments with large bandwidth-delay
        products.  Finally, generating fewer ACKs may cause needless
        retransmission timeouts in lossy environments, as it increases the
        possibility that an entire window of ACKs is lost, forcing a
        retransmission timeout."</t>
  
        <t> Any ACKing scheme that increases the ACK ratio beyond 2 needs to
        compensate for these possible issues.</t>

        <t> When network links have highly asymmetric capacities (such as in
        Cellular, DOCSYS cable or satellite networks) a high proportion of the
        opportunities to send might be used for purely ACK traffic. </t>

        <t> This document suggests a modification to the ACK ratio for steady
        data streams and provides the considerations required to implement a
        higher ACK ratio safely.  </t>

        <section title="Implications of Return Path Asymmetry">

            <t>The TCP Performance Implications RFC <xref
            target="RFC3449"></xref> describes a series of problems and
            mitigations from using an asymmetric path.  Performance problems
            arise in several access networks, including bandwidth-asymmetric
            networks (such as broadband satellite access, DOCSIS cable
            networks, cellular mobile, etc), where a limited ACK rate results
            in constraining the throughput on both forward and return paths.
            This is a significant factor for paths with a capacity asymmetry
            greater than approx 1:40 (one ACK per TCP Segment).</t>

            <t>Where the ACK rate is limited by the capacity of the return path
            this motivates the need to scale the ACK rate, or increase the
            number of segments/packets that are acknowledged by each ACK
            packet.  Historically, "stretch ACKs" (an ACK that covers multiple
            received segments) have been considered to be an undesirable
            network pathology, because they can result in bursts of
            transmission. The use of ACK Thinning (deleting some TCP ACKs
            within a PEP device,) will lead to reception of Stretch ACKs (that
            cover more than one TCP MSS of data).  An alternative is to either
            compress the ACKs on the radio segment or to reconstruct the ACK
            stream in a PEP after the radio segment.</t>

            <t>Capacity is not the only asymmetric path constraint.  In some
            network technologies (e.g., return link RRM allocation in a
            satellite BoD system, or an LTE scheduler in mobile) the
            transmission of ACKs across a network segment can also consume
            significant resource and therefore the cost to the user/operator of
            the network segment. This provides an incentive to reduce rate (or
            volume) of ACK traffic.</t>

            <t>Reducing the rate of ACKs can also benefit wired scenarios by
            reducing the computational effort required to process ACKs and the
            rate of cache ejection for Generic Receiver Offload (GRO), both
            important in optimising network interfaces for high speed
            networks.</t>
